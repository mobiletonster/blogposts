<!-- # Solar Power Fundraiser for Luchi -->
## Lifting another in need
### My Request
My goal is to raise enough funds to help Luchi and her family obtain consistent electrical energy through a solar power system. I am seeking about $20 from 40 of my friends, which should be enough to cover the cost of materials and installation of a medium sized solar system which will help her to obtain remote work as a software developer.

If you can, please send $20 via venmo to `@TonySpencer-14` and mark it as `Luchi's solar system donation` or contact me for other options.

### The problem
Luchi Obi is a friend I met via a software mentoring program on the internet. She is from Nigeria.

She has been teaching herself software development and has been seeking remote work. She has been able to get a few opportunities, but without consistent power where she lives, it is difficult to remain online long enough to perform her work. Her family uses gas generators to power their home and can only afford to run it for short periods at a time.

Since the elections in her country, things have gone very badly. Inflation has skyrocketed and the price of fuel has become so expensive that most families, including hers, can no longer afford to run their generators for power. The value of the Naira has plummeted on the world market

This has dramatically impacted her ability to learn and obtain the employment she needs. Her eventual goal is to come to the United States and get an official degree in software development. She will need to raise enough funds through work and other means to apply to the University. Currently, she is looking at Universities here in Utah where we and others can help her by providing lodging and other support.

Adding to the trials that every Nigerian faces during these tough times, Luchi's family is especially struggling as her father, who is the primary bread winner, was recently in an accident that shattered his lower leg and will require several months to heal.

He works doing hard, manual labor boring holes in the ground, and cannot work or obtain income while he is recovering. Her mother sells homemade clothing, but with inflation and people struggling few people are able to purchase her clothing. Needless to say, times are tough right now.

### Attack on Christians
The situation in Nigeria for Christians has gotten quite severe. You need only do a web search and you'll see an alarming number of reports of violence against the Christian population:  [https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=attack+on+christians+in+nigeria&FORM=HDRSC8](https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=attack+on+christians+in+nigeria&FORM=HDRSC8)

Luchi is a Christian, but it is often unsafe to worship publically. She has been joining my church as often as possible via our streaming option and she has pretty much become a member of our congregation!

We have enjoyed having her be a virtual member of the Ben Lomond 10th Ward!

### Backstory of Luchi and Tony
As time permits, I will update this blog post and share more of the back story of how and why we met and how she has become part of our family.

For now, I'd like to say THANK YOU!
