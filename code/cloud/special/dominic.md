If you have ever wanted to truly help another human in need, in a desperate situation but 1) never really found a worthy cause where 2) even a small contribution of just a couple of dollars could truly make an impact and change a life or lives for good, I hear you. 

As nice as “Sub for Santa” is at bringing joy to a family, or kids at Christmas time, it often feels a little less impactful than the situation that Dominic Wilson finds herself in. If you have even a couple of dollars, your collective contributions could change her life and her children’s lives for good so please consider helping if you can.

I found Dominic’s desperate plea for help by happenstance and felt compelled to help, even though I hadn’t really verified her situation personally before doing so. I figured I would never miss the small amount that I contributed even if the cause wasn’t just, but I had an impression her story was true. Later, feeling like there may be more that I could do, I reached out and contacted her and a conversation ensued. I would like to share her story with you.

Dominic is a mother of 3 children, 2 toddlers and a baby living in southwestern Oregon. Her companion and children’s father died last year leaving her with 3 children to raise on her own. Having been raised in the foster system herself as a child, she has no family to fall back on for help and her only friend was her companion.

She was able to survive working for a local grocery store earning a minimum wage. Things were tight, but she was able to make ends meet, earning enough to pay rent for their apartment, cover food, diapers, etc. and pay for childcare to watch her children while she worked. 

Then a few months ago, disaster struck. Her children contracted Covid, likely from childcare. She had no choice but to stay home for the requisite quarantine period with her children, missing a significant amount of work. Then, she eventually succumbed and also contracted Covid, which extended her absence from work, so much so that she was eventually let go. 
With bills mounting and income stopped, she was in trouble, and she knew it. Desperate and without a friend (besides her three little babies as she calls them) she decided to ask for help by reaching out on Go Fund Me. 

Usually when people are in desperate need of help, a friend or a family member will start a go fund me page for the person in need. It is a completely different level of desperation if you are the only one available to start a go fund me page for yourself, such is the case with Dominic. I asked her if she had any friends that could have done it for her, and she said no…her only friends are her children and "they couldn’t do it for her, so she did it for them".

She expressed to me how embarrassing it was for her to have to do this. How humiliating it is, but when you are responsible for other, little lives, you will do what you must to survive.
A few people saw and contributed a little bit of money, but without a wide network of friends to spread her message, her story was relatively lost in the digital kaleidoscope of the vast internet. She was able to pay some back rent which was now piling up, but ultimately not enough to keep from being evicted.

Now she finds herself living in her car with her three children…occasionally garnering enough funds to get a motel room here and there so she can bathe her children and take a shower as she is searching to find a new job. Trouble is, finding a job is hard without an address and without enough money to pay for childcare (her provider requires $250 upfront each month which she considers a fair price) while trying to stretch what little she has to pay for food for her children, diapers and gas for her vehicle so they have heat, it seems that she may never get the boost she needs to get over the hump.

She has applied for housing assistance at homeless shelters, but she is on a waiting list. She is trying to get other assistance, but in the tussle of eviction, misplaced and lost her social security card which is apparently required to get assistance. She said, “do you know how hard it is to get a replacement social security card when you don’t have an address”? 

People have been cruel and vile to her on twitter, posting the most insensitive racial slurs even suggesting that maybe abortion would have been a better alternative for society than the burden of supporting "welfare queens” and “black monkey’s”. No human being deserves to be treated this way, but especially if you don’t know their story and you make assumptions that are incorrect.

I asked her what she would really need to get her over the hump and get her out of her situation. She could have given me a dollar figure, which is what I would have expected, but this is what she said instead:

>“I need to be able to [afford] childcare so I could find a full-time job then find a place [to live], because most places will not let you in a place [housing] without a JOB”

I hope you will feel compelled to help Dominic with even a small contribution to lift her out of her circumstance and get her on her feet. Help restore her faith in humanity and let her know that no one is truly friendless in this world and that there are compassionate and loving people.
There are lots of people like Dominic in this world, more than we individually have the resources to help. It would be easy to throw up our hands and say the problem seem insurmountable, but I am reminded of the “Starfish Story”.

One day a man was walking along the beach when he noticed a boy picking something up and gently throwing it into the ocean. Approaching the boy, he asked, “What are you doing?” The youth replied, “Throwing starfish back into the ocean. The surf is up and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw them back, they’ll die.” “Son,” the man said, “don’t you realize there are miles and miles of beach and hundreds of starfish? You can’t make a difference!”

After listening politely, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and threw it back into the surf. Then, smiling at the man, he said…” I made a difference for that one.”
