## Securing web APIs and SPA (single page applications)

### Introduction
Before we can properly secure our applications, we need to understand the different types of web development options and hosting or server strategies.

### Types of web sites/apps
This can get pretty involved, but generally there are 4 major categories of web sites/apps:

1. Traditional web
2. Applets - flash, silverlight, java applets
3. SPA - single page applications
4. Web Assembly - Blazor

Microsoft has a basic guide to explain the tradeoffs between these application styles in more detail:

Even within these categories, there are several sub-options and methods for creating web apps.

#### Traditional web

The definition of a "traditional" web app or site may be a bit fuzzy, but in general the server plays a larger role as opposed to other app models where much of the work is pushed to the client browser itself.

#### Applets - flash, silverlight, java applets, ActiveX

Applets 


#### SPA - single page applications

These are traditionally heavy javascript client side monolithic apps.

#### Web Assembly - Blazor

The future of web apps probably lies with Web Assembly.
