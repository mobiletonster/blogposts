## How to ensure web workload is installed on VS2019 or VS2022

Some people have asked for a guide on how to ensure that the ASP.NET Core `Web Workloads` are installed in Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022.

### Installation of Web Workload in VS2022
You can download VS 2022 Community Edition (free) from <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visualstudio.microsoft.com</a>

When the installer loads, ensure that the `ASP.NET and web development` workload is checked.

If you didn't check this during the initial install, you can launch the Visual Studio Installer and click the `Modify` button next to the edition you have installed. (screen shot depicts Enterprise edition, but Community edition follows the same flow.)
