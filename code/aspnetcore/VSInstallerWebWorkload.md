## How to ensure web workload is installed on VS2019

Some people have asked for a guide on how to ensure that the ASP.NET Core `Web Workloads` are installed in Visual Studio 2019.

### Installation of Web Workload in VS2019
You can download VS 2019 Community Edition (free) from [visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

When the installer loads, ensure that the `ASP.NET and web development` workload is checked.

If you didn't check this during the inital install, you can launch the Visual Studio Installer and click the `Modify` button next to the edition you have installed. (screen shot depicts Enterprise edition, but Community edition follows the same flow.)
